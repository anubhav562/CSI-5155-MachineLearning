# Machine Learning
##### Let's explain what Machine Learning is in simple terms.

Machine Learning, in most simple terms, is the science of making the computers / systems learn from experience (data).
This can be compared to the learning process in humans. Humans tend to learn from their past experience, machine 
learning is the art of achieving the same for computers.

Talking in terms of systems/computers, **this experience comes in the form of learning from the data**.

Machine learning includes the study of algorithms which learn from the provided data, and these algorithms are not
explicitly programmed to perform the task.


#### Key components of machine learning:

- Data - data is required in machine learning as this is the only ingredient using which the algorithm is made to learn.
These days, machine learning is being applied across almost every domain whether it be healthcare, finance, investment 
banking, e commerce and what not. 
- Algorithm - this algorithm is provided with the data and the algorithms learn from the data to output a model.
There are a lot of existing machine learning algorithms available in the scikit learn library which we are going to see
in the future. Some of these are linear regression, logistic regression, K nearest neighbours and etc.
- Model - Model is the entity which is stored/saved using which we actually make predictions.
Model consists of model data and the prediction algorithm. Model Data are generally the values which are 
learned after the algorithm is made to run on the data. Later on, prediction is made using the model data and 
the prediction algorithm.

For better understanding of the difference between a machine learning algorithm and a model, I recommend going through 
this 15 minutes read by Jason Brownlee.

[Machine Learning Algorithms vs Machine Learning Models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-algorithm-and-model-in-machine-learning/)


After going through the above read, now we can say that there is an involvement of 2 algorithms in the .

- The first being the one to which the data is fed and this is the actual **Machine Learning Algorithm**.
- The second one being the prediction algorithm which uses the model data to predict the results.

All the topics that we would be covering in the initial parts of this repo would look like isolated dots, but once we 
start diving into the code and specific algorithms, these topics would start making more sense and the isolated dots
would start connecting.
